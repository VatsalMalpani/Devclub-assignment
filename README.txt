Hi !
You will find my work arranged in folders in fragments.
That is because I wasn't able to finish creating a website for a library management system.
I'm new to development, so I had a rough start....Although I learned TOO many new things in the time I had for this assignment.
And for that, I sincerely thank you.
Now, about my work....
The part that I wasn't able to figure out in time is the integration of all the pieces together.
I have submitted all the pieces of the puzzle (HTML pages,SQL tables,Javascripts) that I wasn't able to put together along with my trials.(I tried to do it using node js, but I couldn't do it in time)
It is my sincere request that you consider me for admission in the club as I have a blazing passion for learning.(I learned EVERYTHING that I submitted, and more, during the past week)
Thank You for reading this far. Peace.
